## User Story
As a user of a media curation app, I want an AI-powered tool that sorts my digital memories by emotions and events so that I can easily relive and share meaningful moments without sifting through disorganized files.

## User Journey
**Current State:** Users like Wilujingri, Nikola, Agnieszka, Amrit, and Jacob struggle to locate specific media files due to scattered storage across various platforms and lack of emotional tagging. The process of finding and organizing memories is manual and time-consuming, leading to frustration.

**Future State:** With NostalgiaHub, users interact with a seamless, AI-powered interface that automatically curates media based on emotional significance, creating easily accessible themed albums. This results in effortless browsing and sharing of cherished memories, enhancing the user's connection to the past.

## Problem Statement
NostalgiaHub users need a cohesive digital space that automatically organizes their scattered digital memories by emotions and events. Current tools require significant manual effort and lack intuitive emotional tagging and search capabilities. The design of the app should ensure smart organization, easy sharing, and facilitate a meaningful emotional connection with usersâ€™ past memories.

## Key Takeaways
- The primary need across personas is for an efficient AI system that sorts memories by themes and emotions.
- A unified platform across devices is crucial for maintaining consistent organization and easy access.
